**Dynamic Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Data Streams with Concept Drift**

This repository contains the implementation of our research on using dynamic contrastive self-supervised learning combined with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for detecting anomalies in multivariate data streams, particularly under concept drift conditions. This approach aims to improve robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios where data distributions evolve over time.

## Datasets

The following datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method:

- **KDD Cup 99**:  
  A benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection, containing a wide variety of simulated intrusions in a military network environment.
